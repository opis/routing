Routing framework
------------------
**Opis Routing** is a framework for building various routing components. In contrast to other routing libraries,
it may handle anything that follows a pattern and is not limited only to HTTP request.

This library was conceived to be embedded by other libraries that need routing capabilities and not as a
standalone library; although the usage of this library as a standalone library is not discouraged.
